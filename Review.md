# Review for the MA8701 Data Analysis Project "Water Flow Modeling"

Authors: Group 7 (Eirik Berge, Camilla Idina Jensen Elvebakken, Martin Ludvigsen)

Reviewers: Group 5 (Helene Minge Olsen, Florian Beiser, Yaolin Ge)

## General Comments

The group provides an introduction to their data analysis repository in the README.md what is well appreciated by the reviewers. Therein, the authors highlight the relevance of their prediction models for safety as well as energy production and mention the current operational HBV modelling. This gives a clear motivation for their data-driven predition modelling in the subsequent report. 

### README.md

- In the figure for missing data the y-axis could be transformed to a scala with years. 
- Mention quantiles in boxplot description. 



### Exploration of the Data

- Technical comments can be bullet points 
- Where we can refer to code as `variable`



### Linear Models



### Shrinkage



## Conclusion

The authors perform a statistically sound analysis of the given data and develop interpretable prediction models. The methods are more than appropriate for the scope of the project and the results are clearly presented. The report is very well written. (@5: Mention something that is outstanding)

We suggest the following minor amendments:
